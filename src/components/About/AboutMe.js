        <p>Hello, I’m Cameron. I’m a data nerd and coding geek. I like all things that have large amounts in data, because there’s always something to find. Every dataset has a secret and as a data scientist, it’s my job to find it!</p>
        <p>I started coding at the considerably old age (in this era) of 18. I started from having no idea what a pointer was to solving machine learning problems at Bay Area universities and companies.</p>
        <p>I love sports, especially baseball. I hate coffee even though I worked at Starbucks as a barista for a year. I love avocado toast, but I never buy them, they are way too overpriced.</p>
